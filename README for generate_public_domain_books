# Gutenberg Public Domain Book Extractor (Simple Version)

This Python script downloads and extracts the Project Gutenberg RDF catalog and parses metadata to identify public domain books published in or before 1927. It's a straightforward tool for those interested in exploring or narrating classic, legally free texts.

## Features

- Downloads and extracts the official RDF metadata archive from Project Gutenberg.
- Parses each RDF file for book title, author, publication year, and Gutenberg ID.
- Filters books published in or before 1927 (considered public domain in the U.S.).
- Saves results to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas

Usage
Run the script directly from the command line:
python simple_gutenberg_public_domain.py

The script will:

Download the RDF catalog if not already present.

Extract RDF files if not yet extracted.

Parse metadata from each RDF file.

Filter for public domain books published in or before 1927.

Save results to public_domain_books_full.csv.

Output
The resulting CSV file contains these columns:

Title: Book title

Author: Author name

Year: Publication year

Gutenberg ID: Project Gutenberg identifier

Notes
Parsing all RDF files can take several minutes.

The public domain cutoff year is hardcoded as 1927 but can be changed in the script.

The script silently skips any malformed or unreadable RDF files.
